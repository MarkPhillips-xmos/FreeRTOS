FreeRTOS demo for the XCORE200

To get started:
 - Ensure lib_rtos_support and all its dependencies have been cloned at the
   same level as this FreeRTOS repository. One way to do this is to clone the
   lib_rtos_support library with all of its submodule dependencies:
   git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:xmos/lib_rtos_support.git
   This FreeRTOS repository will be included as a submodule.

 - Create an xTIMEComposer workspace at the top level of the lib_rtos_support
   repository.

 - Import the project named `RTOSDemo' found in the FreeRTOS repository at
   /FreeRTOS/Demo/XCORE200_XCC.

 - Use xwaf to build. The xTIMEComposer project has been configured to use xwaf
   so it may also be built from within xTIMEComposer if desired.
